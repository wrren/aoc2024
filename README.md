# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024. I'm using [Elixir Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) to develop
each solution. Inputs for each puzzle can be found under the [inputs](inputs) directory.

## Running Solutions

Install [Elixir Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) and open the `.livemd` for the day you wish to view and run. Each Livebook uses
the `:kino` package to manage steps like accepting inputs and files.
